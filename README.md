# uhdr2avif

A set of minimal Rust crates for Ultra HDR JPEG to AVIF conversion.

## 🖥️ Platform Support

Supports all platforms compatible with the [`lcms2`](https://crates.io/crates/lcms2) Rust crate, which relies on the native [Little CMS](https://www.littlecms.com/) C library.

## ⚠️ Work-in-progress
~~This is a work-in-progress PoC, and is currently a lot slower that it could be~~.

It mostly does its originally intended job now, and the AV1 encoding in rav1e seems to take up most of its runtime.
