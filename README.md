# 🚧 uhdr2avif

A set of minimal Rust crates for Ultra HDR JPEG to AVIF conversion.

## 🖥️ Platform Support

Supports all platforms compatible with [`lcms2`](https://crates.io/crates/lcms2), which relies on the native [Little CMS](https://www.littlecms.com/) C library.

## ⚠️ Work-in-progress
This is a work-in-progress PoC, and is currently a lot slower that it could be.

The main development effort has been on the lib crate, and the bin crate in its current state doesn't do anything at all.
